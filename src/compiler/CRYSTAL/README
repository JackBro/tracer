
 Crystal: a program analysis system for C. 
 -----------------------------------------

Crystal is a program analysis system for C written in Java.
The system is aimed at making it easier to write program analyses 
by providing a canonical program representation; standard program 
analyses; and support for whole-program analysis.

The system is developed at Cornell University. Contributors include:

  Radu Rugina        <rugina@cs.cornell.edu>
  Siggi Cherem       <siggi@cs.cornell.edu>
  Maksim Orlovich    <maksim@cs.cornell.edu>

Directory structure
------------------

The directory structure is:
 - /src: source files
 - /jars: the JFlex and CUP jar files
 - /classes: the generated class files 

The source code directory /src includes:
 - parser: the lexer and parser.
 - ast: the Crystal AST classes for expressions and statements.
 - general: the other IR components: symbols, symbol tables, and types.
 - cfg: the control-flow graph representation. 
 - core: a canonical representation of expressions.
 - analysis: general-purpose program analyses. Currently includes:
     - pointer : memory partitioning via unification-based pointer analysis.
     - alias : alias analysis interface.
     - callgraph : call graph construction.
     - dataflow: standard intra-procedural dataflow analyses.
     - ipa : a generic inter-procedural analysis engine.

The lexer and parser are generated using the JFlex and java_cup tools:
 - JFlex: the fast scanner generator for Java (http://flex.de)
 - CUP : LALR parser generator for Java (http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup)
 
Building and running Crystal
-----------------------------

Requirements: Java 1.5 or higher, and Apache Ant must be available
on your system.

To build Crystal: go to the base installation directory where this
README file is located (we'll refer to this dir as $CRYSTAL) and run ant.
To run Crystal: execute the generated 'bin/crystal' script.
   
      > cd $CRYSTAL
      > ant
      > bin/crystal
