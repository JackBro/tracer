CLP(R) Version 1.2
INSTALLATION NOTES
------------------

This system, consisting of a compiler, byte-code emulator and 
constraint-solver, is written entirely in C.  It has been known to 
run on a number of machines: IBM RS/6000, IBM RT/PC, IBM PS/2-80, 
PC's, Sun 3, Sun 4 and Vaxen, using a number of UNIX[tm]-based operating 
systems: AIX, BSD, Mach and SunOS.  It is expected that only minor 
modifications are needed to accomodate other 32-bit machines 
running a UNIX-based operating system. There is also a port to MS/DOS
and OS/2 2.0 using gcc.

0.  Read the RESEARCH SOFTWARE DISCLAIMER and USER AGREEMENT below.

1.  The CLP(R) manual is in the DOC subdirectory and Chapter 6 contains 
the installation guide. If you have one of the UNIX machines listed
in the installation guide or the Makefile then you should be able
to install right away, otherwise it may be helpful to read the
guide first. For old users of CLP(R) the file "README.NEW" summarizes
the new features and changes in version 1.2 from version 1.1.
A UNIX manual style page is in ./DOC/clpr.1 but it should be customized
for the library path in your installation.

2.  If you are installing on MS/DOS or OS/2 2.0 then you will need to
use the files in the DOS subdirectory. The appropriate README files
there should be used in addition to these instructions.
Note also that many of the files in the DOS directory are symbolic
links to files in this directory.

3.  Decide on a directory to install the library file (eg. /usr/lib/clpr),
and copy the file "./lib/init.clpr" there.

4.  Edit the Makefile for your particular configuration. The variables
which you may need to CC (the C compiler eg. cc or gcc), CCOPT 
(options such as -O, -O2) for specific C compiler options such
as higher optimization levels, LIBPATH (the path to the library from Step 3), 
CLIB (any special libraries required by the C compiler) and OPTIONS. 
(** NOTE: Sometimes -O causes some problems with some C compilers, some
old versions of cc on the Suns have had problems with -O on, also
some compilers may need specific options to invoke the floating point
or have better floating point performance. **) 
The main variable which needs to be changed is OPTIONS and if you have
one of the systems listed in the Makefile, you simply need to use the
sample as your setting for OPTIONS. 
Otherwise for a Unix system adding "-DBSD" or "-DSYS5"
is likely to be sufficient. You may also need to add "-DHZ=XX" where XX
is the resolution of the clock ticks in hertz for System V Unix derivatives.

5.  Run "make clean clpr".

6.  Type "clpr" to see if everything worked. Enjoy ...
For old users, because there is now style checking see (README.NEW and
the manual) which is currently defaulted to be on, your old programs
may generate some warnings. If you don't like this you can either
comment out the style checking in "init.clpr" in the last few lines
or you can turn style checking off with "no_style_check(all)".

7.  There are some simple sample PROLOG and CLP(R) programs in the
EXAMPLES subdirectory which may be used to run some quick verification
tests. Chapter 4.6 of the manual contains a sample session which
may be useful to gain familiarization with the system.

 USER AGREEMENT ---------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     BY ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF THIS EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM
     THE USER AGREES TO THE FOLLOWING:

     a.  This program is provided for the user's personal, non-commercial, 
         experimental use and the user is granted permission to copy this
         program to the extent reasonably required for such use.

     b.  All title, ownership and rights to this program and any copies 
         remain with IBM, irrespective of the ownership of the media on 
         which the program resides.

     c.  The user is permitted to create derivative works to this program.  
         However, all copies of the program and its derivative works must
         contain the IBM copyright notice, the UNESTABLISHED SOFTWARE 
         DISCLAIMER and this USER AGREEMENT.

     d.  By furnishing this program to the user, IBM does NOT grant either 
         directly or by implication, estoppel, or otherwise any license
         under any patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights or

         expressly provided herein.

     e.  The user understands and agrees that this program and any derivative
         works are to be used solely for experimental uses and are not to be
         sold, distributed to a commercial organization, or be commercially 
         exploited in any manner.

     f.  IBM requests that the user supply to IBM a copy of any changes, 
         enhancements, or derivative works which the user may create.  The 
         user grants IBM and its subsidiaries an irrevocable, nonexclusive, 
         worldwide and royalty-free license to use, execute, reproduce, 
         display, perform, prepare derivative works based upon, and 
         distribute, (INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY) copies of any and all such

         do any, some, or all of the foregoing, (including supporting
         documentation).

         Copies of these modifications should be sent to:

               SOFTWARE @ YKTVMV.BITNET

     g.  Technical data and/or commodities furnished under this agreement
         are subject to United States export/reexport control laws and
         regulations.  The user agrees to comply with such laws and

         license authorizing IBM to furnish the technical data and/or 
         commodities to the user.
     
     h.  The user agrees not to export, directly or indirectly, any technical
         data provided by IBM or any direct product of such data to, or to the

         Republic of China, Poland, Romania, Union of Soviet Socialist
         Republics, and Vietnam.
     
     i.  It is a requirement that the assurance from the recipient of the
         tech data be received by IBM prior to the disclosure or export.  It
         need not be in the actual license/contract/or other agreement
         setting forth the deal itself-a side letter is perfectly acceptable.
         The executed copy of the assurance should be retained locally for
