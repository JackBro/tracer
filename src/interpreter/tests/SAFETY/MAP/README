In the paper "Software Model Checking by Program Specialization" a
system called MAP is compared with TRACER which behaves very badly!

The examples from that paper can be obtained from

Commend added by Jorge (08/01/2012):

The programs are too much for TRACER. In order to prove safety we need
either:

- inductive invariants that can be obtained by abstract interpretation
  but not likely by interpolants

- use different interpolants from wp's during the refinement.
