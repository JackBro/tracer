This directory contains the statemate benchmarks used in comparing
BLAST run with interpolating tracer. Also includes supporting files.

In particular,

statemate-timed_noloop_shorter3.c

is a shortened version of statemate.c that can be verified by Blast,
its CLP counterpart is

statemate-timed_noloop_shorter3.clpr

where simplification using shorten_trans has been applied, as it is
with Blast. The run result of Blast (Cygwin, Windows XP SP3, Intel Core
2 Duo, E6550 at 2.33 GHz, 3.25GB RAM) is in the file

RESULTS_statemate-timed_noloop_shorter3.txt
 
Another file

statemate-timed_noloop_shorter5.c

is also a shorter version of the statemate benchmark, with more selective
choice of statements to be included. This is the one that is reported
in SAS '09 draft. Its CLP counterpart is

statemate-timed_noloop_shorter5.clpr

Similarly the results are in

RESULTS_statemate-timed_noloop_shorter5.txt

OTHER EXAMPLES:
===============

joxan-10.c is the example that refines using lots of predicates
(showing the slowness of Blast's refinement process),
though the refinement is done only once.

j4.c is the example that demonstrates that Blast is order n2 while
we are linear.
