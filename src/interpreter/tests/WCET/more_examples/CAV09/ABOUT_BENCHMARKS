(1) Non-rectangular loops: it may occur that the maximum number of
iterations of an inner loop depends on the iteration number of an
outer loop.

(2) Down-sampling: execute one part of the body of a loop less thatn
the rest.

(3) Mutually exclusive paths: the execution of one piece of code
forbids the execution of another.

(4) Data-dependency: it may happen that the execution time of a piece
of code depends on the input data of the program.

(5) Closed-forms are not always possible.

             Non-rect.   Down-samp.  Mutual exc. Unk. Input Closed-forms
