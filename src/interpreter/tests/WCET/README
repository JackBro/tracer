Updated the WCET test programs wrt to the current version of the
compiler which collapses multiple C assignments into the same CLP
transition.

We still keep the older versions which is denoted by old_*. For now,
we can still test the results of the unfolder for the old version as
well as for the current. 
Just make sure that you switch the fact compiler_version/1 (in
test_WCET.clpr) to the correct version, and the implementation of
wcet_transition_cost/2 in tracer_wcet.clpr is consistent with that
change.


Update by Jorge (19/07/2012)

Due to many changes in the compiler in the last year and half, many
tests failed now. I've taken a look at them and they seem ok. It's just
that we need to update them to be consistent with current compilation
since WCET is very sensitive to those changes.

Also, we have a couple of tests playing with ndwp (weakest
preconditions). Unfortunately, the implementation of ndwp for anything
except safety is incomplete. It's the item (4) in FIXME file. So these
tests in the current status of our implementation do not make sense.
