# floppy-prep.c and floppy-prep-dec-cil-prep.c are the ones from transformation2/floppy/
# floppy-prep-dec.c is generated by decompiling floppy-prep.c *BUT WITHOUT SLICING*

Just tried the following experiments on one of the benchmarks (floppy):

1) With CPA-checker, the verification time is around 3.5s for both versions since it's just too fast. However the no. of states visited is 2680 for original and 1705 for decompiled, which indicates it's traversing a smaller state space for the decompiled program.

Running the same with TRACER, the verification time goes from 5s to 1s, and the states count goes from 2635 to 899. So the SPS-CFG also benefits fully and partially eager verifiers.

2) Generating PSCFG without slicing, TRACER is unable to load the decompiled program. CPA-checker is able to however it takes 9s to complete and visits 4371 states. So clearly the slicing played a big role in the state space reduction in (1).
