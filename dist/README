Description: TRACER is a verification tool based on symbolic execution
for finite-state safety properties of sequential C programs.  TRACER
builds a finite symbolic execution tree over-approximating the set of
all concrete reachable states. If the error location cannot be reached
from any symbolic path then the program is reported as
safe. Otherwise, the program may contain a bug. TRACER reports a false
alarm only if the theorem prover fails to prove a valid claim.

The most innovative features of TRACER stem from how it tackles the
"path-explosion" problem and the presence of unbounded loops. TRACER
computes weakest preconditions as interpolants and integrates a novel
counterexample-guided refinement phase within the symbolic execution
process.

REQUIREMENTS
--------------
linux 
jdk  > 1.5 
bash shell

INSTALLATION
--------------
tar -zxvf tracer.0.1.tar.gzip
export TRACER_PATH=_here_path_to_tracer.0.1_

FILES and DIRECTORIES
-----------------------
- tracer.0.1 is the main script 

- lib/C2CLP.jar is the compiler for C programs. It uses
  CIL (lib/cilly) to translate the program into a CLP (Constraint Logic
  Program) program. It also uses:

  * Crystal, a program analysis infrastructure for C developed at
    Cornell University (http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/crystal/).  
    We use it for alias analysis.
    
  * Interproc (lib/frontend) an abstract interpretation-based analyzer
    that uses the Apron Abstract Domain Library.
    (http://pop-art.inrialpes.fr/people/bjeannet/bjeannet-forge/interproc/). 
    We use it for providing inductive invariants.

  * CLP-Prover (lib/clp-prover) a constrain-based tool for interpolant
    generation available from http://www.mpi-sws.org/~rybal/clp-prover
        
  * InvGen (lib/invgen) an invariant generator available from
    http://pub.ist.ac.at/~agupta/invgen/.

- lib/clpr and lib/clpr.init are the files of the CLP(R) system
  version 1.2b, a Constraint Logic Program system developed at IBM.

- src/tracer.0.1_debug.clpr is the implementation of the symbolic
  execution interpreter written in CLP(R).

- src/tracer.0.1.clpr is an optimized implementation of the symbolic
  execution interpreter written in CLP(R).

- tests/ and benchmarks/ are small programs used for regression tests
  and real benchmarks.


USAGE
------

  % ./tracer.0.1 -help

  usage: ./tracer.0.1 program [options]
  program is the name of the program to be verified.
  General options:

  -help                            print this message
  -optimized-version         [n|y] turn on/off an optimized version (default n)
                                   If y then dot files are not generated.
  -alias                     [n|y] turn on/off alias analysis  (default y)
                                   (unsound if n)
  -mccarthy                  [n|y] turn on/off mccarthy solver (default n)
  -convert-strict-ineq       [n|y] convert strict inequalities into
                                   non-strict inequalities     (default n)
  -convert-eq-to-ineq        [n|y] convert equality into inequalities (default n)
  -intp                         x  choose interpolation method
                                   x=none  -- no interpolation  
                                   x=sp    -- use of strongest postconditions (default)
                                   x=wp    -- use of weakest preconditions.
                                   x=clp   -- use CLP-Prover 
  -loop-inv                     x  use external loop invariants (default none)
                                   x=none      -- none
                                   x=octagon   -- octagon   abstract domain
                                   x=polyhedra -- polyhedra abstract domain
                                   x=invgen    -- InvGen tool
  -h                            x  choose heuristics during refinement
                                   x is integer between [1...4] (default 2)

INPUT
-------
A program should be annotated at least with one
_TRACER_abort(cond). Of course, multiple _TRACER_abort(cond) are also
allowed.

OUTPUT
---------
TRACER generates automatically dot files of the transition system
associated with the program and the symbolic execution
tree. If "-optimized-version y" then those dot files are not
generated.

If the program is unsafe, TRACER also displays the feasible
counterexample.

ABOUT OPTIONS
--------------

- "-convert-strict-ineq y" converts x>y into x>=y+1 and x<y into x+1<=y.  
  Note this is sound only if x and y are integers.

- "-convert-eq-to-ineq y" converts x=y into x>=y and x<=y.

- "h [1...4]" chooses different heuristics to guide the refinement.
   1-2 refine starting bottom-up from the spurious counterexample.
   3-4 refine starting top-down from the spurious counterexample.

ABOUT EXTERNAL TOOLS
----------------------

- CLP-Prover is used optionally to compute interpolants (-intp clp)
  and it is available from http://www.mpi-sws.org/~rybal/clp-prover/

- InvGen is used optionally to generate loop invariants (-loop-inv
  invgen) and it is available from http://pub.ist.ac.at/~agupta/invgen/

- InterProc is used optionally to provide inductive
  invariants (-loop-inv octagon and -loop-inv polyhedra) and it is
  available from
  http://pop-art.inrialpes.fr/people/bjeannet/bjeannet-forge/interproc.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
* No support for recursive functions
* Unsound with function pointers
