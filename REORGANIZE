  decompi
  gtrace  
  tracer
  tracerclp

  Do we need compi, decompi, and tracerclp ?

  remove: 
    rev_prog and rev_prog.pl 
    cilly
    runcil

external
  invgen
  crystal: move everything here from src/compiler/CRYSTAL
  frama-c

  clp-prover: who is using clp-prover, invgen? CLP(R) uses but it has
              already a subdirectory for it.
  cil
  crest
  CLP(R): yes, we should move CLP(R) here

lib  
  *.jar

  Note that there are many executables and scripts here from external
  tools.  For sure, we need to move them from here. Should we remove
  them? They should be already in external directory

src
  - compiler: put here directly all the files under antlr. That is,
    all compiler/antlr/* files move to compiler/
  - interpreter  same

dist:  same (although i will do some cleanup and make some changes)
 
classes same

gui: move here from src/compiler/GuiFrontEnd

******
Also, note that we need to compile cil. Otherwise, the compiler
reports error. This a requirement and we must explain it.

It seems that it's more convenient to run TRACER+CREST using directly
the crest commands:

crestc    ...
run_crest ...

I think we could generate a simple script and put it in the bin
directory.
