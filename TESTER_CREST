I think I'm done, but it's a bit complicated. Mainly because of some
machine dependent stuff.

Kindly update SVN and follow the instructions in
$TRACER_PATH/lib/crest/README (also attached here).

Examples and benchmarks are present in
$TRACER_PATH/lib/crest/mytest. I added a script "cleancrest" which
will clean intermediate files Crest spits out.

-----

For the demo I recommend showing test2.c (SOS example). Btw for this
use WP but for big benchmarks use SP, since WP slows down a lot.

Steps to do to run TRACER with Crest:

1) Download yices-1.0.11 for your system http://yices.csl.sri.com/download-old.shtml
   and extract it somewhere (this is an external dependency of Crest). If you are
   on Linux, it's usually yices-1.0.11-i686-pc-linux-gnu-static-gmp.tar.gz (32bit)
   or yices-1.0.11-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-static-gmp.tar.gz (64bit)

2) cd $TRACER_PATH/lib/crest/src and open Makefile. Edit the YICES_DIR to point
   to the dir of yices-1.0.11 you extracted in step 1

3) make

4) cd $TRACER_PATH/lib/crest/cil (this is the CIL version used by Crest)

5) ./configure && make

6) cd $TRACER_PATH/lib/cil-1.3.7 (this is the CIL version we use)

   Note CIL needs OCaml. We tried with 3.11 but it does not work. The
   version we tested is 3.12.1

7) ./configure && make

8) cp obj/x86_LINUX/cilly.asm.exe $TRACER_PATH/lib/cilly

That's it. Assuming you sorted out any other dependency issues, you can now run
programs with TRACER+Crest.

To run Crest _alone_ on, say eg1.c:

1) $TRACER_PATH/lib/crest/bin/crestc eg1.c (this will instrument/compile eg1.c)

2) $TRACER_PATH/lib/crest/bin/run_crest ./eg1 123456 -dfs

   where 123456 is the iteration limit and -dfs is strategy (-cfg is another)
3) To run Crest with TRACER:
   $TRACER_PATH/lib/crest/bin/run_crest ./eg1 123456 -dfs -tracer_nosub -sp

   where -tracer_nosub will run TRACER but with *no subsumption* (we used this to
   count %subsumption, overhead etc. for the paper)

   -tracer_sub will run TRACER with subsumption (Crest will listen to memo table)

   last option is either -sp or -ndwp for SP or NDWP interpolants.

IMPORTANT: CLPR should only be compiled with -DLINUX -DCC_CSET and not anything else!
