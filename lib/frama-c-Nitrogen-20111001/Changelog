	      counter + fixes various issues

-* Logic      [2010/09/30] Priority is used for pretty printing predicates.
o!* Kernel    [2010/09/30] Major changes in the kernel. Mainly merge the old
	      modules Datatype and Type into a single most powerful
	      library called Type. The API of these libraries changes.

	      Consequently, some other API changes. By side effect, a lot
	      of functions of module Cilutil has been removed and replaced
	      by their counterpart in module Cil_datatype.

	      The script bin/boron2carbon.sh fixes most changes
	      automatically. Feel free to use it to upgrade your plug-in.

	      Frama-C kernel.

-  Logic      "reads" clauses on logic functions and predicates, which
	      disappeared with the introduction of axiomatic blocks, have been

	      volatile variable. Analysis logs may change slightly as a result.
-  Value      [2008/11/21] Introduced preliminary support for state
	      reductions on a memory read access. This should eliminate
	      some redundant alarms.

	      pointers that are compared to belong to the same allocated
	      memory block, which can be expressed in logical annotations
	      using equality of \base_addr constructs.
-  Impact     [2008/11/04] In the GUI, new panel to manage impact analysis
	      actions.

	      highlighting when the source function is called, for CAT/AF
	      evaluation.

	      type" (bts #?338).
